Project Description

The College Admission Website is a user-friendly and informative platform designed to facilitate the college admission process. The website is implemented using the Angular framework, which ensures a smooth and interactive user experience. The project includes the following main pages:

1. Main Page

The Main Page serves as the landing page of the website. Its primary purpose is to introduce the college and provide an overview of the website's contents. The key features of the Main Page include:
·	College introduction and mission statement
·	Highlights of the college's achievements and facilities
·	Navigation links to other pages (Admission Form, Courses Available, and Contact)

2. Admission Form Page

The Admission Form Page allows prospective students to apply for admission to the college. This page includes a well-structured form that collects essential details from applicants. The form includes fields for personal information, academic background, course preferences, and other relevant information. Upon submission, the data is stored in Excel for further processing by the college administration.

3. Courses Available Page

The Courses Available Page provides comprehensive information about the various courses offered by the college. It includes details such as course names, durations, eligibility criteria, and brief descriptions. This page aims to help prospective students make informed decisions about the courses they wish to pursue.

4. Contact Page

The Contact Page allows users to get in touch with the college administration for any inquiries or assistance related to the admission process or other general queries. The page includes contact details, such as email addresses and phone numbers, along with a contact form for sending messages directly to the college.

Additional Features

Apart from the main pages mentioned above, the College Admission Website includes the following features:
·	Responsive design: The website is optimized for various devices, ensuring a seamless experience on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
·	Navigation: The site offers a user-friendly navigation system, allowing users to easily switch between pages.
·	Excel Integration: The admission form data is stored in Excel, enabling efficient data management for the college administrators.

Project Conclusion

The College Admission Website project successfully accomplishes its objective of providing an online platform for college admissions. It caters to prospective students, offering them valuable information about the college and its courses. The project team, consisting of Mithun R, Sanjay P, and Gopikandhar, has put in considerable effort to develop a well-organized and functional web application.
The absence of a login page is a deliberate design choice, as the website aims to provide general information and facilitate the admission process without the need for user accounts.
The project's success can be attributed to the effective utilization of Angular and Excel, which has enabled the creation of a dynamic and data-driven website.
